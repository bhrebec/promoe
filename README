Required dependencys:
	* QT4.2.x           http://www.trolltech.no/
	* XMMS2             http://xmms2.xmms.org/
	* XMMS2 C++ bindings (make sure to have boost_signals when compiling xmms2)
	  - promoe works with 0.4DrK and 0.5DrL

Optional dependencys:
	* Avahi     http://www.avahi.org/

Compiling:
	1) Run qmake in the topdir (not in ./src)
	   (on debian systems it's called qmake-qt4)
	2) Run make
	3) Have a coffe
	4) ./promoe
	5) ????
	6) profit

Compilation problems:
	- Errormessage "WARNING: Found potential symbol conflict of <somefile>"
	  -> make sure you use uic from Qt4 (uic -version)
	     (on debian systems it's sufficant if uic-qt4 exists)

	- Errormessage "error: xmmsclient/xmmsclient++.h: No such file or directory"
	  followed by a bunch of other errors
	  -> You don't have the xmms2-c++ header files installed
	     (package libxmmsclient++-dev on debian)
	     After installing the headerfiles run 'make distclean' and start again 
		 from 'Compiling 1)'

Reporting Bugs:
	preferred way to report bugs is through xmms2's bugtracker at
	'http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/' at project 'Client - Promoe'

Patches:
	Best practice to submit a path is through the bugtracker at
	'http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/' at project 'Client - Promoe'.

	Either append the patch to the bug it fixes or supply a link to your own
	git repository

	To discuss a patch of wanted feature , you can also try to reach the
	developer at xmms2's irc channel #xmms2 on freenode (irc.freenode.net)
